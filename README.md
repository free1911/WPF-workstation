WPF workstation

This project is a tryout of building WPF application. 
The aim of this app is to get an intigrated workspace for daily fileworks. 
My first idea is to build a light weight spreadsheet editor which should cover most functionalities in MS excel.
All the functions should be able to run without MS Office installed.
Support for different formats.
Tools for batch processing of data files.
Build with C# using VS2017. Platform: Windows. .net Framework version: 4.0
